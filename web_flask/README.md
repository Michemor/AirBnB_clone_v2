A web framework is a software used to manage the development of a web application
Web frameworks simplify the developers work by providing a boilerplate, something like
a blueprint that one can use to start from.
So instead of starting from scratch, various programming languages implement the use of 
frameworks.
Web application development consists of client and server side development.
Client side frameworks include React, Vue.js, Angular, ...etc.
Server side frameworks include Django, Ruby, Express and Symfony.
Most frameworks employ the Model-View-Controller architecture to define the
functionality of the framework.
The MVC architecture's components is described as shown below:
- Model: defines the section that handles a major part of the business logic i.e. database queries,
	logic layers, guidelines and functions.
- View: handles visual representation of data i.e. graphs and charts. Defined as functions.
- Controller: acts as a bridge between the model and view, receiving input from the view and sending it
to the model and vice versa

Some of the features offered by frameworks include:
1. URL mapping: defining of routes that assit the user while navigating from 
one page to another
2. Web caching
3. Web template system
4. Scaffolding
